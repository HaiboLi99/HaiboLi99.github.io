### Welcome!

Mathematics is the study of numbers, quantities, shapes, structures, and patterns, as well as the relationships between them. It involves abstract reasoning and logical deduction to understand and describe the world around us in a precise and systematic way. Mathematics can be applied in countless fields, such as science, engineering, economics, and even art, to solve problems, model real-world phenomena, and make predictions.

### About me

I work on applied and computational mathematics. I am currently a Research Fellow in School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Melbourne. I completed my Ph.D. in Tsinghua University, China, in 2021.

My research centers around utilizing mathematical modeling and computational techniques to address challenging problems in scientific computing, matrix computation and data science. My research interests mainly include:
* Inverse problems, regularization
* Numerical linear algebra, matrix analysis and computation
* Scientific machine learning

I am always looking for collaborate with researchers from mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence and etc. For discussion of potential collaborations, please reach out to me by <a href="mailto:haibolee1729@gmail.com" target="_blank"> haibolee1729@gmail.com</a> <br/>
