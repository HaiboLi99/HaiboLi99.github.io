### Welcome!

Applied mathematics is the application of mathematical methods by different fields such as physics, engineering, medicine, biology, finance, business, computer science, and industry. Thus, applied mathematics is a combination of mathematical science and specialized knowledge. 

Theoretical physics is a branch of physics that focuses on the development of mathematical models and theories to understand and explain natural phenomena.
It plays a crucial role in our understanding of the fundamental laws of the universe and the fundamental particles that make up all matter.
Research in theoretical physics helps us to make predictions about how the universe works and to test these predictions through experiments.
It also helps us to understand the fundamental principles that govern the behavior of matter and energy, and to explore the limits of our current knowledge.
Theoretical physics helps us to make progress in a wide range of fields, including cosmology, particle physics, and quantum mechanics, and it has led to many important discoveries and technological innovations.

### About me

I work on applied and computational mathematics. I am currently a Research Fellow in School of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of Melbourne. I completed my Ph.D. in Tsinghua University, China, in 2021.

My research centers around utilizing mathematical modeling and computational techniques to address challenging problems in scientific computing, matrix computation and data science. My research interests mainly include:
* Inverse problems, regularization
* Numerical linear algebra, matrix analysis and computation
* Scientific machine learning

I am always looking for collaborate with researchers from mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence and etc. For discussion of potential collaborations, please reach out to me by <a href="mailto:haibolee1729@gmail.com" target="_blank"><i class="fa fa-envelope fa-1x"></i> haibolee1729@gmail.com</a> <br/>
