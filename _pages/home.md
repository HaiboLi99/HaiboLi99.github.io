### Welcome!

I am currently a Research Fellow in <a href='https://ms.unimelb.edu.au/' target='_blank'>School of Mathematics and Statistics, University of Melbourne<a>, working on applied and computational mathematics. I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics from <a href='https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/' target='_blank'>Tsinghua University<a>, China, in 2021. See <a href='https://mathgenealogy.org/id.php?id=273430' target='_blank'>Haibo Li<a> at the <a href='https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_Genealogy_Project' target='_blank'>Mathematics Genealogy Project.<a>


### Research

My research centers around utilizing mathematical modeling and computational techniques to address challenging problems in scientific computing, matrix computation and data science. My research interests mainly include:
* Inverse problems, regularization
* Numerical linear algebra, matrix analysis and computation
* Scientific machine learning

I am always looking for collaborate with researchers from mathematics, statistics, artificial intelligence and etc. For discussion of potential collaborations, please reach out to me by <a href="mailto:haibolee1729@gmail.com" target="_blank" style="text-decoration: underline;">haibolee1729@gmail.com.</a>

<!-- ### About Mathematics

Mathematics is the study of numbers, quantities, shapes, structures, and patterns, as well as the relationships between them. It involves abstract reasoning and logical deduction to understand and describe the world around us in a precise and systematic way. Mathematics can be applied in countless fields, such as science, engineering, economics, and even art, to solve problems, model real-world phenomena, and make predictions.
